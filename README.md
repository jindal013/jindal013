# hey, i'm chinmay ðŸ‘‹

i'm an 18-year-old developer from toronto.

this summer, i'm exploring autoformalization architectures using lean at  non-trivial. previously, i've built a [fine-tuning platform](https://github.com/jindal013/finetune-marketplace) for non-technical creators, an mcp client to make [autonomous hardware interfaces](https://github.com/jindal013/intellisense), and a semantic search engine for startups. before that, i helped launch a [wildfire prediction pipeline](https://github.com/FireWatch-ai/fireWatch) that raised $10k. 

last year, i interned at nokia on their ml team to develop retrieval pipelines. i also taught [competition math](https://live.poshenloh.com/stars) to kids around the world. on the side, i produce guitar riffs for a record label.
