# hey, i'm chinmay 👋

i'm an 18-year-old developer from toronto.

i recently published a zero-to-one guide on [scaling modern transformers](https://jaxformer.com/) with n-d parallelism in jax. 

last summer, i explored autoformalization architectures using lean at  non-trivial. previously, i built a [fine-tuning platform](https://github.com/jindal013/finetune-marketplace) for non-technical creators, an [autonomous robotic arm](https://devpost.com/software/dum-e-kgx6at) via fast inference, and a semantic search engine for startups. 

last year, i interned at nokia on their ml team to develop retrieval pipelines. i also taught [competition math](https://live.poshenloh.com/stars) to kids around the world. on the side, i produce guitar riffs for a record label.
